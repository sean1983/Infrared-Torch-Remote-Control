Infrared LED Torch project, i'm want to design this torch to allow long-range data communication and remote computer control around the house using a standard torch form factor.

i hope to give it the ability to send commands and instructions via Infrared.

The torch will be built around an ESP32-P4 MCU and powered by a 350mAh 3.7v Li-Po battery, ensuring reliability and durability. Remote computer systems will receive signals through an Infrared sensor and communicate via serial, with Python programs facilitating different commands to trigger actions on host systems.

This Infrared LED Torch project is intended to be a great addition to home automation systems, enhancing control over devices around the house and garden.
